This repository contains all the code for my solution (written in Python 3) for
solving all the puzzles of the [[http://adventofcode.com/2017][Advent of Code 2017]] challenges. Although not in
a competitive way (living in UTC+01 is quite a handicap, since the challenges
are released at 6AM), I was able to complete all the challenges on December
25th

Some of the challenges may require a bit of refactoring and optimization, and I
expect to write a bit more on it soon (whether on this repository or on a blog
post); but the code can be interesting for some people and I decided to release
it as soon as possible. Feel free to open an issue or contact in case of doubt.
